Description::
A *prefetch.w* instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block containing
the effective address is likely to be accessed by a data write (i.e. store) in
the near future. An implementation may opt to cache a copy of the cache block in
a cache accessed by a data write in order to improve memory access latency, but
this behavior is _not_ required.

Operation::
