CMO instructions are defined in the following extensions:

* <<#Zicbom>>
* <<#Zicboz>>
* <<#Zicbop>>

Cache block management instructions and cache block zero instructions operate on
the cache block containing the effective address equal to the base address
specified in _rs1_. Cache block prefetch instructions operate on the cache block
containing the effective address equal to the sum of the base address specified
in _rs1_ and a sign-extended offset encoded in the _imm_ field, where
offset[4:0] shall equal 0b00000. The effective address is translated into a
corresponding physical address by the translation mechanisms appropriate in the
effective privilege level.
