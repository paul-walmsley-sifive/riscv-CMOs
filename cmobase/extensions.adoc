CMO instructions are defined in the following extensions:

* <<#Zicbom>>
* <<#Zicboz>>
* <<#Zicbop>>

Cache block management instructions operate on the cache block containing the
effective address equal to the base address specified in _rs1_. Cache block zero
instructions operate on the cache block or naturally aligned power-of-two
address range equal in length to the cache block size containing the effective
address equal to the base address specified in _rs1_. Cache block prefetch
instructions operate on the cache block containing the effective address equal
to the sum of the base address specified in _rs1_ and a sign-extended offset
encoded in the _imm_ field, where offset[4:0] shall equal 0b00000. The effective
address is translated into a corresponding physical address by the translation
mechanisms appropriate in the effective privilege level.
